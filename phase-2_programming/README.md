## Python Crush Course


### [Part I: Basics](./phase-2_programming/python-crush-course/)

#### Why Python?
Python is easy to learn and use, making it great for beginners.
It's widely used in the IT industry for various tasks, from automation to data analysis.

#### Python's Growth and Resources
Python has evolved significantly since its release, becoming more powerful and versatile.
Abundant resources like online courses, documentation, and communities support Python learners.

#### Learning and Support
Programming involves trial and error, and seeking help is crucial.
Remember that even experienced programmers rely on resources and collaboration.

#### Python is:
- a general purpose scripting language;
- a popular language used to code a variety of applications;
- a frequently used tool for automation;
- a cross-platform compatible language;
- a beginner-friendly language.

#### Python is not: 
- a platform-specific / OS-specific scripting language;
- a client-side scripting language;
- a purely object-oriented programming language.

#### Installing Python on Different Operating Systems
A good resource to help with the installation of Python on different Operating Systems is the [Chapter-1](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/chapter_01/README.html) of the Python Crush Course git repository.


#### Difference between Syntax and Semantic errors in Programming.
**Syntax - the Rules of the Road**

- In Python, even small typos like a missing bracket or an extra comma can lead to syntax errors, preventing your code from running.
- Pay close attention to details and be mindful of potential syntax errors like misspellings, incorrect indentations, and mismatched data types.

**Semantics - Ensuring Your Code Does What You Want**

- Semantics deals with the meaning and logic of your code. Even if your code is syntactically correct, it might not produce the desired output if the logic is flawed.
- Common semantic errors include unintended output due to incorrect code logic and poorly structured code design.

* Syntax errors occur when you violate these rules, like misspelling a word or forgetting a punctuation mark.

* Semantic errors occur when your code is syntactically correct and runs without issues, but it doesn't produce the intended output because of flawed logic.

#### Running the First Python Program To Test Python Environment
1. Create a directory for all the Python projects/code in any directory or drive of your choice.

```bash
mkdir "python-crush-course"
```
2. Navigate to the **python-crush-course** directory.

```bash
cd "python-crush-course"
```
3. Create a file with the name **hello_world.py** and add the code below.

```bash
print("Hello Python World!")
```
